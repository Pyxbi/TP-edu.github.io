               Edu-gaming abbreviates integrated of education and gaming . We came up with idea of this name because we want to create an application that not only help students can gain knowledge but also create for them a gaming platform which can promote their motivation in education. Moreover, our group is also not interested in the traditional learning style so our team decided to take this name.

                   I am twenty-one and this is my last semester before I receive my master degree of International Business. I am studying this course due to having an interest in IT and how IT affects business. I love playing video games and reading books in my free time. Industry 4.0 allows businesses to have productivity improvements, cheaper and faster customization of products or services, better maintenance, and savings across labour or manufacturing costs. I believe that I can use the knowledge from studying about IT to further improve my skills in managing my business in the future. I do not have much knowledge and experience in IT so I want to enhance my skills in this field.

           <h2 class="sub-text1">Overview</h2>
           <div class="inner-heading" >Topic</div>
           <div class="text"> Studying can be stressful and tedious for a lot of students which leads to a percentage of student dropout due to not finding any motivation in education. According to Catherine (2006), out of 467 dropout students from 25 major cities, 69% of them claimed that a lack of motivation was the reason for their dropouts. Because of that, our group developed an interest in the topic of online learning with a mix of blockchain technology. Online learning has become more and more popular especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Online learning is very useful for students thanks to it providing flexibility for students to study when and wherever they want. However, not even online learning can deal with the lack of motivation that only students but teachers also face. According to Caduceus (2021), 76% of undergraduate students and 56% of graduate and professional students identified a lack of motivation as the biggest obstacle to success in online learning. Our group believed that if we put some kinds of clear objectives in online learning, it could help students be more motivated in studying. Therefore, we decided to create a concept that runs on a blockchain platform that allows students/pupils to endorse a role-playing game to make studying more fun and interactive. With a mix of world-building, role-playing, and studying platforms we would give students and participants a learn-to-earn experience. This project also creates a healthy competitive environment that everyone would enjoy.</div>
           <div class="inner-heading" >Motivation</div>
           <div class="text">
               <p>Being university students ourselves, we understand that not only us but many students in the world find that education is very boring sometimes. We see that students feel bored â…“ of the time in class and have insufficient skills for work. The evidence is that 90% of Vietnamese students lack soft-skills, which is hard for employers to train them and costs time for them after they graduate. Based on that, we developed an online environment that allows students to both study while also being motivated thanks to its learn-to-earn experience. This platform is based on the development of learning platforms such as Canvas but those just support the learning resources otherwise our platform will provide for the users, mainly students, and lecturers more widely such as inspiring studying through interactive learn-to-earn.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Nowaday, most college students have either a phone or a laptop to use in their study. That is why we decided that our project will be a website so that students can access our project easily. We thought this was a great chance to make the project experience more like working in a large technology company. Not only do we learn to work in a professional environment, but we also have to learn to work effectively in a group with people with different mindsets. This will be a great foundation for us to improve our soft-skills when working in a team so that we will be able to work effectively when working for big technology companies.

               <p>
                   We might be the first pioneer in developing education games on blockchain technology. Our project can be seen as highly distinguishable from the market, especially in Viet Nam. However, our design is aiming to compete with the two widely-used educational platform which are:
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Canvas</li>
                   <li>Doulingo</li>
                   <li>LMS</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                   Our platform will almost have all the features that both of the products above have. However, these platforms still contain a lot of out-dating features that give bad user experience. Not only that, there are still more common problems such as:
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Users often feel lonely due to the lack of communication</li>
                   <li>The homepage, interface could be improved to be more attractive and convenient</li>
                   <li>Does not include rewards and other offers</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Based on user's essentials, we not only aim to solve all of the common problems that current educational platforms have. But, we also plan to add many more unique features that are associated with the blockchain technology. </p>

           <h2 class="sub-text1">Detailed Description</h2>
           <div class="inner-heading">Aims</div>
           <p class="text">The most important thing for our project is to be able to create a great interactive learn-to-earn experience. Having clear goals while also having great rewards is the main motivation that we hope we can bring to our users. This project needs to create an online world in which students can come in to study with great motivation whether it is for fun or for the rewards. This project could also monitor your process so that users would be able to see their achievement in the end. In order to make our project become true, we have defined some goals for our process of development</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">An RPG-like UI</div>
           <p class="text">Our aim in this project is to make the process of studying instead of being tedious and boring, it would feel like you are playing a RPG game. With this, students would be more motivated to study more.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">UX</h3>
           <p class="text">When making a good learn-to-earn experience for the users, we need to make sure that we have a great balance between learning and rewards so that every user would be rewarded according to their study. Achieving this balance is very important as users need to see their hard work being rewarded fairly and therefore create a fair environment for everyone to study at their own pace being motivated to learn. We need to also make sure that users are able to see a great fantasy-like RPG environment so that they can emerge in the world instead of treating it as fetch quests.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">Verified Learning Course</h3>
           <p class="text">This website is not only for students but also for teachers who want to provide a great but also effective learning process. With teachers providing great quests and also lessons, they could create a great learning course with clear steps so that students can learn effectively in the end.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">A Healthy Platform</h3>
           <p class="text">This product will not only benefit each user individually but also serve as a platform for social interaction, friend-making, progress sharing, and goal-setting. This will help students feel like they belong to a community that shares the same goals of wanting to learn while also making great friends in the future.</p>

           <p class="text">In the first part of the project, the team needs to finalize the idea that we want to make and continue to make adjustments so that everyone can easily visualize the product.</p>
