               Edu-gaming abbreviates integrated of education and gaming . We came up with idea of this name because we want to create an application that not only help students can gain knowledge but also create for them a gaming platform which can promote their motivation in education. Moreover, our group is also not interested in the traditional learning style so our team decided to take this name.

I am studying this course due to having an interest in IT and how IT affects business. I love playing video games and reading books in my free time. Industry 4.0 allows businesses to have productivity improvements, cheaper and faster customization of products or services, better maintenance, and savings across labour or manufacturing costs. I believe that I can use the knowledge from studying about IT to further improve my skills in managing my business in the future. I do not have much knowledge and experience in IT so I want to enhance my skills in this field.

           <h2 class="sub-text1">Overview</h2>
           <div class="inner-heading" >Topic</div>
           <div class="text"> Studying can be stressful and tedious for a lot of students which leads to a percentage of student dropout due to not finding any motivation in education. According to Catherine (2006), out of 467 dropout students from 25 major cities, 69% of them claimed that a lack of motivation was the reason for their dropouts. Because of that, our group developed an interest in the topic of online learning with a mix of blockchain technology. Online learning has become more and more popular especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Online learning is very useful for students thanks to it providing flexibility for students to study when and wherever they want. However, not even online learning can deal with the lack of motivation that only students but teachers also face. According to Caduceus (2021), 76% of undergraduate students and 56% of graduate and professional students identified a lack of motivation as the biggest obstacle to success in online learning. Our group believed that if we put some kinds of clear objectives in online learning, it could help students be more motivated in studying. Therefore, we decided to create a concept that runs on a blockchain platform that allows students/pupils to endorse a role-playing game to make studying more fun and interactive. With a mix of world-building, role-playing, and studying platforms we would give students and participants a learn-to-earn experience. This project also creates a healthy competitive environment that everyone would enjoy.</div>
           <div class="inner-heading" >Motivation</div>
           <div class="text">
               <p>Being university students ourselves, we understand that not only us but many students in the world find that education is very boring sometimes. We see that students feel bored ⅓ of the time in class and have insufficient skills for work. The evidence is that 90% of Vietnamese students lack soft-skills, which is hard for employers to train them and costs time for them after they graduate. Based on that, we developed an online environment that allows students to both study while also being motivated thanks to its learn-to-earn experience. This platform is based on the development of learning platforms such as Canvas but those just support the learning resources otherwise our platform will provide for the users, mainly students, and lecturers more widely such as inspiring studying through interactive learn-to-earn.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Nowaday, most college students have either a phone or a laptop to use in their study. That is why we decided that our project will be a website so that students can access our project easily. We thought this was a great chance to make the project experience more like working in a large technology company. Not only do we learn to work in a professional environment, but we also have to learn to work effectively in a group with people with different mindsets. This will be a great foundation for us to improve our soft-skills when working in a team so that we will be able to work effectively when working for big technology companies.
               </p>
           </div>
           <div class="inner-heading">Landscape</div>
           <div class="text">
               <p>
                   We might be the first pioneer in developing education games on blockchain technology. Our project can be seen as highly distinguishable from the market, especially in Viet Nam. However, our design is aiming to compete with the two widely-used educational platform which are:
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Canvas</li>
                   <li>Doulingo</li>
                   <li>LMS</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                   Our platform will almost have all the features that both of the products above have. However, these platforms still contain a lot of out-dating features that give bad user experience. Not only that, there are still more common problems such as:
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Users often feel lonely due to the lack of communication</li>
                   <li>The homepage, interface could be improved to be more attractive and convenient</li>
                   <li>Does not include rewards and other offers</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Based on user's essentials, we not only aim to solve all of the common problems that current educational platforms have. But, we also plan to add many more unique features that are associated with the blockchain technology. </p>
           </div>
           <h2 class="sub-text1">Detailed Description</h2>
           <div class="inner-heading">Aims</div>
           <p class="text">The most important thing for our project is to be able to create a great interactive learn-to-earn experience. Having clear goals while also having great rewards is the main motivation that we hope we can bring to our users. This project needs to create an online world in which students can come in to study with great motivation whether it is for fun or for the rewards. This project could also monitor your process so that users would be able to see their achievement in the end. In order to make our project become true, we have defined some goals for our process of development</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">An RPG-like UI</div>
           <p class="text">Our aim in this project is to make the process of studying instead of being tedious and boring, it would feel like you are playing a RPG game. With this, students would be more motivated to study more.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">UX</h3>
           <p class="text">When making a good learn-to-earn experience for the users, we need to make sure that we have a great balance between learning and rewards so that every user would be rewarded according to their study. Achieving this balance is very important as users need to see their hard work being rewarded fairly and therefore create a fair environment for everyone to study at their own pace being motivated to learn. We need to also make sure that users are able to see a great fantasy-like RPG environment so that they can emerge in the world instead of treating it as fetch quests.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">Verified Learning Course</h3>
           <p class="text">This website is not only for students but also for teachers who want to provide a great but also effective learning process. With teachers providing great quests and also lessons, they could create a great learning course with clear steps so that students can learn effectively in the end.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">A Healthy Platform</h3>
           <p class="text">This product will not only benefit each user individually but also serve as a platform for social interaction, friend-making, progress sharing, and goal-setting. This will help students feel like they belong to a community that shares the same goals of wanting to learn while also making great friends in the future.</p>  
           <div class="inner-heading">Plan And Progress</div>
           <h3 class="sub-text">Idea and Proposal</h3>
           <h4 class="sub-text1">Description:</h4>
           <p class="text">In the first part of the project, the team needs to finalize the idea that we want to make and continue to make adjustments so that everyone can easily visualize the product.</p>

We use Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator because of their famous designing graphics for UI and a wide range of users. These excellent tools also help our group create a variety of assets, icons, animations, and images. And another tool that we use is Figma which is a tool that combines all the graphics into the actual interface for the app. With Figma, our group can create a ​​well-suited for rapid prototyping. It also helps investors or people in the business department visualize clickable elements and simulate user interactions. Huy is also undertaking this session because he used to learn how to use it before so it is easy for him to use those design tools.</p>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bolder;" class="text">Advanced graphics for a website</p>
           <p class="text">To create the website for the users, our group needs to learn more about 3D Modeling and Rendering, the tool we considered approach is Blender(Version 3.5) which is used in a metaverse environment because it provides powerful features in creating 3D models. Furthermore, to make project graphic interactive visualizations directly in a web browser we need to have WebGL and Three.js.</p>
           <h3 class="topic-text">Applicaiton development tools</h3>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;" class="text">Tools: Visual Studio Code (Version 1.78), Remix-Ethereum (Version 3.0.27)</p>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bolder;" class="text">Website version</p>
           <p class="text">To accomplish this project we need to use various tools to develop easily and relevant to our project. We choose Visual Studio Code as the IDE because it is a free IDE from Microsoft and has a lot of utility operations. The programming language that we use to develop is JavaScript(primarily use this language because ) and with the combination of HTML and CSS, it will make a well-structured website. Furthermore, because this website operates on a blockchain platform so Solidity is the best programming language for us to choose because its structure of it is quite similar to JavaScript, and the IDE we use to code Solidity is Remix where we can develop a smart contract to define our project logic and store relevant data on the blockchain. To make the front end more attractive to the users, our group suggests using React.js because this framework enables the creation of interactive and responsive user interfaces. The payment method and receiving rewards are different with web2 so we need to integrate the wallet functionality into our website to connect the user’s blockchain wallet and interact with game-edu. Therefore, we use Metamask a popular browser wallet extension with Ethereum-based dapps (decentralized applications). There are additional tools to handle non-blockchain-related components such as cloud technologies. Besides, the off-chain component can use IPFS(InterPlanetary File System) as decentralized storage solutions.</p>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bolder;" class="text">Advance technologies</p>
           <p class="text"><strong>Metaverse</strong> is the technology that helps our product solve the tediousness of traditional learning. It can simulate real-world scenarios, historical events, or scientific concepts, making learning more engaging and memorable which is helped students/learners in doing exercise</p>
           <p class="text"><strong>Artificial Technology</strong> will be used in the future for our project due to AI will improve the quality of our products. The technique that can be used in Machine Learning, it will create AI assistants which support real-life teachers, and they can help learners quickly to contact without timeline limits and the shortage of workers</p>
           <div class="inner-heading">Testing</div>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;" class="text">Our project, which is based on blockchain technology, it requires many crucial approaches and plans to ensure success. Starting with the validation of the project requirements to ensure that the game's design and objectives align with the educational purposes and blockchain integration.This step is crucial to guarantee that our game effectively incorporates blockchain features and meets the desired educational goals. Next up will be the internal testing which our development team will try to identify and fix bugs or errors after we tested out one of the first samples of the game.The tool that our group choose to test this project is Truffle which is known for built-in testing functionalities that make it easier to write and execute tests for smart contracts.</p>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;" class="text">To maintain the experience of users before alpha and beta testing we need to guarantee that all the testing such as Network, Regression, Performance, and Security is employed and stable. Then we will approach the next step, which is the alpha and beta testing phase. Several limited groups of early potential adopters and testers will give feedback on the overall gameplay experience, the effectiveness of educational content, and any technical issues encountered. Gathering their feedback will help identify many areas for future improvement.</p>
           <p class="text">After completing the development phase, a final round of user testing should be implemented in a period of time. To find test users, many strategies can be employed such as cooperating with clubs in the university or other educational institutions to involve students and teachers as testers, ensuring the project will approach a  diverse group with various educational backgrounds to try out the game. The success criteria for our project is to receive positive feedback from testers for its educational value and enjoyment. The game should function with minimal technical issues, with no bugs or errors. We need to ensure the integration with security standards will protect user data privacy as one of our highest priorities.</p>
           <div class="inner-heading">Risks</div>
           <h1 style="margin-top: -30px; " class="text">Time management</h1>
           <p class="text"><strong>Problem:</strong> We all have the same amount of time, but due to the courses and various projects, time management might will be a challenge for us. Lack of time management might cause bad quality of project work.</p>
           <p style="margin-top: 15px" class="text"><strong>Solution:</strong> Our aim is to achieve a fair distribution of workload by considering both time availability and individual strengths. This approach will ensure that no member is overwhelmed with excessive tasks and everyone gets the chance to showcase their abilities.</p>
           <h1  class="text">Lack of knowledge</h1>
           <p class="text"><strong>Problem:</strong> Our project is developed based on blockchain technology and this technology is pretty new for everyone even the programmers so it requires a lot of effort from our group to learn and update our knowledge frequently. More specifically, our group needs to have deep knowledge of Solidity to build smart contracts, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and databases. Because our members in the group is a newbies in IT, we need time to learn and provide knowledge about those previous requirements, that is the reason why our group can not fully develop the project in reality and see how it works.</p>
           <p style="margin-top: 15px"  class="text"><strong>Solution:</strong> From those problems we also find ways to solve it, the alternative ways to make our project easier for everyone to visualize is to make a prototype. For instance, our group use Figma and a variety of graphic design applications to demonstrate our concept. </p>
           <h1  class="text">Cost</h1>
           <p class="text"><strong>Problem:</strong> Throughout the project, all of the tasks from presentation, creating a prototype, and designing the graphic of the project are not paying anything. However, building up a blockchain game education will cost us extremely expensive when hiring human resources, paying the cost for blockchain platforms such as transaction fees and gas fees, marketing and promotion, and a lot of things about technology and design. </p>
           <p style="margin-top: 15px" class="text"><strong>Solution:</strong> We need to bring out our project to the investors and tell them how our outcome of projects can help people, especially show for them the potential to earn more money in this field </p>
           <h1   class="text">Performance</h1>
           <p class="text"><strong>Problem:</strong> Some inexpectation errors occur when the users employ the website such as smart contract bugs, user error or the outcome of the project does not adapt to the expectation of users. </p>
           <p style="margin-top: 15px" class="text"><strong>Solution:</strong> Creating a chatbox or customer support to take all the feedback from the users is a crucial part to solve and also provides them with general knowledge about blockchain such as how to connect the wallet with the account. </p>
           <h1  class="text">Communication</h1>
           <p class="text"><strong>Problem:</strong> Miscommunication or misunderstanding is often one of the significant factors that brings failure to any project. The differences in thoughts and understanding will form unprofessional work ethics which is the reason for miscommunication. If a member works ahead without noticing the team, they will indirectly slowing down the team project.</p>
           <p style="margin-top: 15px" class="text"><strong>Solution:</strong> To facilitate effective communication, we have established clear communication rules and commitments. Additionally, we prioritize face-to-face meetings as they provide a better platform for interaction and understanding. These measures contribute to enhancing our overall communication effectiveness.</p>
           <div class="inner-heading">Communication</div>
           <p class="text">The project has been operating for two months since our group assembled. There were some misunderstandings and conflicts interaction between members at the beginning, but we have overcome all the difficulties and continue to do our best to succeed in the project. We usually hold all the meetings online in the first five weeks, which is more convenient because we can access many resources and conveniences in our spaces. We will try to conduct a few meetings each week so that we can know and understand more about the progress of our project. For the last few weeks until the final deadline, we will meet up more outside class times to rehearse and showcase the project or help each other on their sections. Because we only have three members it is easier for us in some ways to meet up without missing any members. It is necessary for each member to finish their duties, so we must continue the frequency of our communication and meetings to succeed in our project.</p>
           <p class="text">Two communication platform that we are using is:</p>
           <div style="margin-top: -10px;" class="text">
               <ul>
                   <li>Discord because it can share screens and has many convenient tools to use</li>
